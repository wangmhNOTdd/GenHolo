We will describe the content of the `index`, `systems`, `clusters`, `splits`, `links` and `linked_structures` directories in detail below, the rest are described in the [miscellaneous section](#miscellaneous-target).

### Annotation tables (`index/`)

Tables that lists all systems along with their annotations.

- `annotation_table.parquet`: Lists all systems and their annotations.
- `annotation_table_nonredundant.parquet`: Subset of systems without redundant systems.

:::{include} table.html
:::

`Mandatory`: The column has a non-empty, non-NaN value in for all PLINDER systems.
`Example`: An example non-empty, non-NaN value for the given column in a PLINDER system.

### Systems (`systems/`)

This directory contains all the systems used in the dataset. The systems are grouped into zipped subdirectories by using two penultimate characters of PDB code (`two_char_code`). The purpose of this grouping is to make loading and querying speed palatable.

Each unzipped subdirectory, contains folders named by `system_id` that contain the structure files.

```bash
|-- {two_char_code}
    |-- {system_id}
        |-- chain_mapping.json # Mapping between the chains in the receptor and the chains in the system
        |-- ligand_files # Mapping between the ligand in the receptor and the ligands in the system
        |-- receptor.cif  # Receptor mmcif file
        |-- receptor.pdb # Receptor pdb file
        |-- sequences.fasta # Receptor sequence fasta

### Linked structures (`linked_structures/`)

This directory contains the linked apo and predicted structures for PLINDER systems. These structures are intended to be used for augmenting the PLINDER dataset, eg. for flexible docking or pocket prediction purposes.
The files are grouped into zipped subdirectories by using `two_char_code` of the system.
Each unzipped subdirectory contains `pred` and `apo` subfolders that in turn contain folders named by `system_id`.
Inside each `apo/{system_id}` and `pred/{system_id}` folder is another directory containing a superposed system: `{source_id}_{chain_id}/superposed.cif`, where `{source_id}` and `{chain_id}` for apo systems is `pdb_id` with a source chain identifier, and for predicted structures, `{source_id}` is `uniprot_id` used in AF2DB with a chain identifier set to `A`.

### Miscellaneous

Here we briefly describe subdirectories and their files that are not part of the main dataset but are used in the dataset processing pipeline.
These files should be considered intermediate products and are not intended to be used directly, only for development purposes.

#### Database processed files (`dbs/`)

This directory contains the intermediate files of PDB structures that were successfully processed and scored by Foldseek and MMseqs2 pipeline.
It is used in splitting to make sure that only successfully computed systems are used for splitting.

```bash
|-- subdbs
|   |-- apo.csv
|   |-- holo.csv
|   |-- pred.csv
```

Each file is a CSV with a single column: `pdb_id`.

#### Raw annotations (`entries/`)

This directory contains intermediate raw annotation files prior to consolidation. The files are grouped into zipped subdirectories by using `two_char_code`.
Each subdirectory, contains `{pdb_id}.json` files with raw annotations for every system found in given `pdb_id`.

#### Small molecule fingerprints (`fingerprints/`)

Tables that contains all the ligand fingerprints used in calculating ligand similarity stored in `ligand_scores`.

- `ligands_per_inchikey_ecfp4.npy`: `numpy` array of all-vs-all ECFP4 similarity.
- `ligands_per_system.parquet`: table linking PLINDER systems to their ligands, including ligand ID, SMILES, InChIKey, etc.
- `ligands_per_inchikey.parquet`: subset of `ligands_per_system.parquet` with reduced number of columns.

#### Small molecule data (`ligands/`)

Ligand data expanded from entries for computing similarity, saved in distributed files `{hashid}.parquet`.
